📊 Student Performance Analysis

Analyze and visualize student performance data to uncover insights about how gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation affect student scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.
This project demonstrates Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and Visualization using Python.

🧠 Skills Demonstrated

Python Programming

Data Analysis using Pandas & NumPy

Data Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Handling Missing Data

Generating Insights from Visual Patterns

📊 Key Visualizations
1️⃣ Gender Distribution

Shows the count of male vs female students.

2️⃣ Scores vs Parental Education Level

A heatmap showing the impact of parental education on Math, Reading, and Writing scores.

3️⃣ Math Score Boxplot

Displays distribution, spread, and outliers in Math scores.

▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Install required libraries:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

2. Ensure the CSV file is in the same folder or update its path inside main.py.
3. Run the script:
python main.py

📈 Insights Gained
