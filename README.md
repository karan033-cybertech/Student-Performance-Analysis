# 📊 Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance to understand how factors such as gender, parental education, lunch type, and test preparation influence scores in Mathematics, Reading, and Writing.

The analysis focuses on data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python.
